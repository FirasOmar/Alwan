	<h1>Alwan Terms and Conditions of Use</h1>
<p>
Hey guys! Welcome to Alwan's Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms"). Our lawyers insist that we impose rules on users to protect all of our hard work. This is a contract between you and Alwan Trading Inc and we want you to know yours and our rights before you use the Alwan application ("App"). Please take a few moments to read these Terms before enjoying the App, because once you access, view or use the App, you are going to be legally bound by these Terms (so probably best to read them first!).
</p>
    <li class = "section">
        <h4 class = "title">ALWAN RULES</h4>
        <p>Before you can use our awesome App, you will need to register for an account ("Account"). In order to create an Account you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>have a Facebook account (and who doesn't these days?);</li>
            <li>be at least 18 years old; and</li>
            <li>be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of your home country.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to use another person's Account without permission - that just wouldn't be fair!</p>
		<p>You'll have great fun on Alwan, but if you feel the need to leave, you can delete your Account at any time by going to the 'Settings' page when you are logged in and clicking on the 'Delete account' link. Your Account will be deleted immediately but it may take a little while for Your Content to be completely removed from the App. We will save your profile information in case you realise you miss us and you decide to restore your Account (which you can do within 30 days of de-activating your Account). Alwan Trading Inc reserve the right at our sole discretion to terminate or suspend any Account, or make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the need to give you prior notice.</p>
		<p>You may not access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the App or our systems. Certain portions of the App may not be accessible if you have not registered for an Account. </p>
       
    </li>
    <li class = "section">
        <h4 class = "title">TYPES OF CONTENT</h4>
        
        <p>There are three types of content that you will be able to access on the App:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>content that you upload and provide ("Your Content");</li>
            <li>content that members provide ("Member Content"); and</li>
            <li>content that Alwan Trading Inc provide ("Our Content").</li>
        </ul>
		<h5>There is certain content we can't allow on Alwan</h5>
		<p>We want our users to be able express themselves as much as possible and post all sorts of things on Alwan, but we have to impose restrictions on certain content which</p>
		   <ul>
            <li>contains language which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person</li>
            <li>is obscene, pornographic or otherwise may offend human dignity</li>
            <li>is abusive, insulting or threatening, or which promotes or encourages racism, sexism, hatred or bigotry;</li>
			<li>encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence</li>
            <li>is defamatory or libellous</li>
			<li>relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);</li>
            <li>involves the transmission of "junk" mail or "spam";</li>
			<li>contains any spy ware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programmes or other malicious code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software, hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data or personal information whether from Alwan or otherwise;</li>
            <li>itself, or the posting of which, infringes any third party's rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights);</li>
			<li>shows another person which was created or distributed without that person’s consent; or</li>
			<li>incorporates the image or likeness of any individual under 18 years of age.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Alwan operates a zero-tolerance policy for this kind of content</p>
		<h5>Your Content<h5>
		<p>As Your Content is unique, you are responsible and liable for Your Content and will indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content. Sorry that was a bit of a mouthful, but you are what you post!
You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you do choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances.
As Alwan is a public community, Your Content will be visible to other users of the App all around the world instantly - so make sure you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. By uploading Your Content on Alwan, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights and licences to do so, and automatically grant us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use Your Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creative derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general publish such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).
We may assign and/or sub-licence the above licence to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you.
We have the right to remove, edit, limit or block access to any of Your Content at any time, and we have no obligation to display or review Your Content.
</p>
<h5>Member Content</h5>

You do not have any rights in relation to other users' Member Content, and you may only use other Alwan users' personal information to the extent that your use of it matches Alwan's purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your Account if you misuse other users' information.
Member Content is subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 512(c) and/or 512(d) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998. If you have a complaint about Member Content, please see the Digital Millennium Copyright Act section below for more information.
</p>

<p>You may be wondering what happens to the rest of the Content on Alwan. Well, it belongs to us! Any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, and other intellectual property appearing on Alwan are owned, controlled or licensed by us and are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights. All right, title and interest in and to Our Content remains with us at all times.
We grant you a non-exclusive, limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable, license to access and use Our Content, without the right to sublicense, under the following conditions:

</p>
<ul>
<li>you shall not use, sell, modify, or distribute Our Content except as permitted by the functionality of the App;</li>

        <h4 class = "title">RESTRICTIONS ON THE APP</h4>

Therefore, you can report any abuse or complain about Member Content by contacting us, outlining the abuse and/or complaint. You can also report a user directly from a profile or in chat by clicking the 'Block & Report' link</p>

        <h4 class = "title">MISCELLANEOUS</h4>
        
        <p> There are a few more things we need to mention before you can use Alwan. Please bear with us, we're nearly done!
<ul>
<li>Firstly, those standard clauses at the end of most contracts (boring, we know)<p>These Terms, which we may amend from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and Alwan Trading Inc. The Terms supersede all previous agreements, representations and arrangements between us (written or oral). Nothing in this clause shall limit or exclude any liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.
Alwan Trading Inc has taken reasonable steps to ensure the currency, availability, correctness and completeness of the information contained on Alwan and provides that information on an "as is", "as available" basis. Alwan Trading Inc does not give or make any warranty or representation of any kind about the information contained on Alwan, whether express or implied. Use of Alwan and the materials available on it is at your sole risk. Alwan Trading Inc can not be held responsible for any loss arising from the transmission, use of data, or inaccurate User Content.
You are responsible for taking all necessary precautions to ensure that any material you may obtain from Alwan is free of viruses or other harmful components. You accept that Alwan will not be provided uninterrupted or error free, that defects may not be corrected or that Alwan Trading Inc, or the server that makes it available, are free of viruses or bugs, spyware, Trojan horse or any similar malicious software. Alwan Trading Inc is not responsible for any damage to your computer hardware, computer software, or other equipment or technology including, but without limitation damage from any security breach or from any virus, bugs, tampering, fraud, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer line or network failure or any other technical or other malfunction.
</p></li>
<li>We know our Terms are awesome, but we may have to change them now and again<p>As Alwan grows, we might have to make changes to these Terms so we reserve the right to modify, amend or change the Terms at any time (a "Change"). If we do this then the Changes will be posted on this page and we will indicate the Effective Date of the updates at the bottom of the Terms. In certain circumstances, we may send an email to you notifying you of a Change. You should regularly check this page for notice of any Changes – we want our users to be as informed as possible.
Your continued use of Alwan following any Change constitutes your acceptance of the Change and you will be legally bound by the new updated Terms. If you do not accept any Changes to the Terms, you should stop using Alwan immediately (uh oh, that's going to be hard!).
</p></li>
<li>Some more legal mumbo jumbo<p>If, for any reason, any of the Terms are declared illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from the Terms and the remainder of the Terms shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.
No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under the Terms shall operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any variation of the Terms and nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise of the right or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that</p>
<ul>
<li>you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and</li>
<li>you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties</li>
</ul>

By submitting your personal information, or by choosing to upgrade the services you use, or by making use of the applications available on Alwan, you agree to the transfer of your personal information to, and storage and processing of your personal information in, any such countries and destinations</p>
<p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or resources. In such cases, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for</p>
<ul>
